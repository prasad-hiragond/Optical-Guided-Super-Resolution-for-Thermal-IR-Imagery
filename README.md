# Optical-Guided-Super-Resolution-for-Thermal-IR-Imagery
Optical-Guided Super-Resolution for Thermal IR Imagery enhances low-resolution thermal images using high-resolution optical (RGB) images as guidance. The approach improves spatial details and edge clarity while preserving radiometric temperature information for applications like surveillance, healthcare, and industrial inspection.
